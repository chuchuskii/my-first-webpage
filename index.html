            If you have been watching the olympics, no doubt seen<br>
            sweeping shots of the iconic Christ the Redeemer monument<br>
            overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Beyond its breath taking views, the<br>
            statue has a colorful history very different from how it does today.<br>
            Here are a few facts about <em>Cristo Redentor,</em> as it's known in its<br>
            native Portuguese.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>1. IT CAME IN RESPONSE TO "AN ADVANCING TIDE OF GODLESSNESS."</h3>
            Following the creation of the Brazilian republic in 1889, which<br>
            seperated church and state, fear began to grow amongst<br>
            Catholics that the nation was headed towards a precipice. After<br>
            World War I, followers felt they needed a symbol to counteract<br>
            what they saw as increasing "godlessness" throughout the<br>
            country. In 1920, they selected engineer Heitor da Silva Costa's<br>
            design of a statue of Christ to be situated atop Mount Corcovado<br>
            overlooking the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>2. THE ORIGINAL DESIGN WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM<br>WHAT WE SEE TODAY</h3>
            Da Silva's initial sketch of christ carrying a cross<br>
            in one hand and a globe in the other. The statue, he noted, should<br>
            facing the rising sun. While the design initially won over the<br>
            project's organizers, it quickly gained the playful name "Christ<br>
            with a ball." After surveying the corcovado from various points<br>
            throughout the city and consulting with Brazilian artist Carlos<br>
            Oswald, Da Silva Costa came up with a new design: an Art Deco,<br>
            arms-wide-open Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>3. CONSTRUCTION TOOK NINE YEARS.</h3>
            <img src="rio.jpg" alt="rio">
        </p>
        <p>
            Da Silva Costa traveled to France in search of a world-class<br>
            sculptor to turn his divine design into reality. He eventually<br>
            commissioned Paul Landowski, a French-Polish sculptor who<br>
            further sharpened the statue’s Art Deco design. Over the next<br>
            several years, Landowski fashioned the 98-foot tall sculpture in<br>
            clay pieces, which were then shipped to Brazil and remade with<br>
            reinforced concrete.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>4. IT'S COVERED WITH 6 MILLION STONE TILES.</h3>
            Reinforced concrete, which had just recently been developed, was<br>
            one of the few materials strong enough to support the statue and<br>
            its wide-wingspan design. But Da Silva Costa and others felt<br>
            concrete was too rough for the fine contours of Christ’s image.<br>
            Afraid that his monument would end up a failure, Da Silva Costa<br>
            found inspiration in a fountain along Paris’s Champs Elysees.<br>
            Tiles lining the fountain accentuated its curves in just the way Da <br>
            Silva Costa hoped to see in his design. He immediately updated<br>
            the project’s plans, and eventually chose soapstone to craft the<br>
            tiles. According to the BBC, workers who made the tiles<br>
            frequently wrote on the back, meaning Christ the Redeemer is<br>
            littered with hidden messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>5. WEATHER HAS TAKEN A TOLL.</h3>
            <img src="clouds.jpg" alt="clouds">
        </p>
        <p>
            Wind and rain have worn away at the statue’s stone tiles,<br>
            necessitating numerous restorations over the years. Christ the<br>
            Redeemer is also a frequent target of lightning strikes. Although<br>
            most fizzle out on its numerous lightning rods, the monument<br>
            has taken some damaging hits recently.<br>
            Just before the World Cup in 2014, lightning singed the back of<br>
            the head and zapped off the tip of a finger, leaving Rio scrambling<br>
            to make repairs before the eyes of the world were upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>6. IT WILL PROBABLY GET DARKER.</h3>
            When Da Silva Costa decided to cover the statue with soapstone<br>
            tiles, he chose a very light colored strain from a quarry near the<br>
            city of Ouro Preto. It was the same stone used by the 18th<br>
            century Brazilian sculptor Aleijadinho, whom Da Silva Costa<br>
            greatly admired. Unfortunately, the quarry has run dry, and<br>
            restoration experts are having a hard time replicating the stones’<br>
            light gray hue when they have to replace them. A spokesman for<br>
            Brazil’s National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage<br>
            recently told the BBC that when the next major renovation<br>
            happens in 2020, replacement stones will be darker. "The stones<br>
            of Christ are hard to find," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>7. THERE'S A CHAPEL AT THE BASE.</h3>
            To celebrate the monument's 75th anniversary in 2006,<br>
            authorities built a small chapel at its base. So yes, you can get<br>
            married beneath Christ the Redeemer. However, there's limited<br>
            space inside, and making the slow journey to the top (cog train<br>
            to an elevator to an escalator) in full wedding attire may not be<br>
            everyone's idea of romance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>8. A 2003 RENOVATION MADE THE JOURNEY TO THE TOP <br>MUCH EASIER.</h3>
            <img src="people.jpg" alt="people">
        </p>
        <p>
            For years, visitors to Christ the Redeemer had to scale around<br>
            200 steps to get from the train station to the statue. After many<br>
            complaints about accessibility, Rio decided to install a series of<br>
            escalators and elevators in 2003 to make the route easier. Today,<br>
            you can get to the statue with the same ease as getting to the top<br>
            floor of a mall.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>9. A DEFACING IN 2010 WAS DEEMED A NATIONAL CRIME.</h3>
            A couple of acrobatic graffiti artists scaled the statue while it was<br>
            being renovated and wrote all over the head, arms, and chest.<br>
            Rio’s mayor, Eduardo Paes, called the act a "crime against the<br>
            nation." The vandals eventually turned themselves in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>10. A CROSS OR INVITING A HUG? DEPENDS ON HOW YOU<br>LOOK AT IT.</h3>
            Rather than depict Christ carrying a cross, Da Silva Costa<br>
            designed the figure to resemble a cross with his outstretched<br>
            arms. Scholars have noted that this symbolizes a bridge between<br>
            traditional depictions of Christ, which typically showed him<br>
            nailed to or carrying a cross, and modern ones. Today, Brazil is a<br>
            much more religiously diverse nation, and many view the statue’s<br>
            gesture as one of welcoming and peace. In 1969, Brazilian artist<br>
            Gilberto Gil wrote a song inspired by the monument called "That<br>
            Hug" ("Aquele Abraço").
        </p>

            <h3>11. IT'S ONE OF THE SEVEN NEW WONDERS OF THE WORLD.</h3>
            <img src="sunset.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2007, more than 100 million people voted on the<br>
            New Seven Wonders of the World from a list of 21 finalists<br>
            (the competition was put on by the New Open World Corporation, so<br>
            take that for what you will). Christ the Redeemer made the cut,<br>
            along with the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu, and the<br>
            Roman Colosseum. Sorry Eiffel Tower—maybe next time.
